You became hooked with social media and Twitter? If you wanna change that, try this App.

The App WAS a very low level twitter client. You can use the old code to build your own cool client or to learn how <i>Twitter Kit</i> and API works.

<b>Twitter Service Issue - BreakingMyTwitter</b>

Since june Twitter makes big ugly changes on their servers. Some changes are really ok. I use TwitterKit from the official Twitter developers, but TwitterKit is unable to set a callback url in the Twitter login button. Thus all login features of my App are removed by Twitter. Please tweet to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterDev">TwitterDev</a>, why do they do this to open-source developers :-(

<b>How to get API Codes</b>

I did not share my API Key and Secret! You have to create your own. Normally all Twitter client request go to a man in the middle app-server to analyse and cache every request (similar to a proxy). WE DO NOT WANT this man in the middle server, who holds API Key and Secret and sending Ad's or do things with our private stuff. Thus: Your client has to hold these Keys and you have to generate your own, because there are request limits to pretend the original Twitter servers from to many requests.

To get API Key and Secret you have to create a "new App" on the Twitter development website. <a href="https://no-go.github.io/ReoTwe/">Details</a>
